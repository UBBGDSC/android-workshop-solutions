# GDG Fall 2024 Android Workshop Exercises

Hello! Hope you've had fun at our workshop. In this repository you will find the project files with the solutions for the exercises given at the workshop, which can be directly opened with Android Studio.

_Note_: Make sure to press Ctrl + Alt + Q after opening the project so that the problem statement gets formatted nicely.


## Using these files:

Open a terminal in the folder that you've chosen to work in and type:

```
git clone https://github.com/UBBGDSC/android-workshop-solutions.git
```

Then hit enter.

That's it. Enjoy!
